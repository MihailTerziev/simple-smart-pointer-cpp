# simple-smart-pointer-cpp
This is simple implementation of a smart pointer class. It allows save usage of dynamic memory. The class encapsulates raw pointer logic and deallocates resources automatically. Instances can be copyied, copy-assigned, moved and move-assigned so that working with them would be flexible and convenient for the user.

However, dynamic instantiating of the class should not be done, as there will be memory leak if the user doesn't call the destructor manually. Purpose of the class is to encapsulate pointer to dynamic memory and free it when not needed anymore, so it should be located on the stack. Original c++11 standard smart pointers are instantiated on the stack but point to dynamic memory. Their destructor deallocates the memory and then the compiler frees the pointer like stack variable. That way the compiler takes care of everything, otherwise it would be redundant and unsafe.

This implementation of smart pointer knows when a copy is made. Making a copy means another instance of the class in which the encapsulated pointer points to the same chunk of memory as the original's one pointer. So when the compiler calls the destructor of the original's instance, it will deallocate the memory and will do nothing when the destructor of a copy is called, so that second deallocation of already freed memory, which will cause memory leak, can't be done.
